Task description

An array A consisting of N different integers is given. The array contains integers in the range [1..(N + 1)], which means that exactly one element is missing.

Your goal is to find that missing element.

Write a function:

    int solution(vector<int> &A);

that, given an array A, returns the value of the missing element.

For example, given array A such that:
  A[0] = 2
  A[1] = 3
  A[2] = 1
  A[3] = 5

the function should return 4, as it is the missing element.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

        N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
        the elements of A are all distinct;
        each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..(N + 1)].

==Solution==
// you can use includes, for example:
#include <algorithm>

// you can write to stdout for debugging purposes, e.g.
// cout << "this is a debug message" << endl;

int solution(vector<int> &A) {
    // write your code in C++14 (g++ 6.2.0)
    if(A.size() == 0){
        return 1;
    }

    sort(A.begin(), A.end());

    for(int i = 0; i < A.size(); i++){
        if(A[i] != (i + 1)){
            return i + 1;
        }
    }

    return A.size() + 1;
}
